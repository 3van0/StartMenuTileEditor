# StartMenuTileEditor
A rudimentary way of changing the tile color and icon of each desktop app in Windows 10 Start menu. 

This app is compatible with Windows 10 version 2004 or lower.

Please note that in Windows 10 Build 20161 Dev, the new UI was introduced for Start Menu, where the background color of most tiles is removed, including those of the apps downloaded from MS Store (typically, UWP apps). Therefore, there is little need to change the tile colors of desktop app tiles and this project is no longer maintained.
